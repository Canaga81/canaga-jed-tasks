    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is 
        not simply random text. It has roots 
        in a piece of classical Latin literature 
        from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
        looked up one of the more obscure Latin 
        words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum 
        passage, and going through the cites of 
        the word in classical literature, 
        discovered the undoubtable source. 
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 
        and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et 
        Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) 
        by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book 
        is a treatise on the theory of ethics, 
        very popular during the Renaissance. 
        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem 
        ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes 
        from a line in section 1.10.32.
